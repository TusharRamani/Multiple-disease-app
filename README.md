![home](https://github.com/TusharRamani/Multiple-disease-app/assets/166124942/db922bb5-8e59-4c9c-a5a3-c8f8e0925a8d)

This project provides a streamlit web application for predicting multiple diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease, using machine learning algorithms. The prediction models are deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

## About the Project : 
Using Machine learning models create a model that can predict multiple diseases. The model will be trained and tested using datasets from Kaggle.Web App is developed using Python’s Streamlit library.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x 

• Kaggle Datasets 

• Jupyter Notebook
