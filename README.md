![home](https://github.com/TusharRamani/Multiple-disease-app/assets/166124942/db922bb5-8e59-4c9c-a5a3-c8f8e0925a8d)

This project provides a streamlit web application for predicting multiple diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease, using machine learning algorithms. The prediction models are deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

## About the Project : 
Using Machine learning models create a model that can predict multiple diseases. The model will be trained and tested using datasets from Kaggle.Web App is developed using Pythonâ€™s Streamlit library.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle Datasets
- Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries:** 
- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: for numerical computing
- Scikit-learn: for machine learning models and evaluation
- Pickle: for saving the model
- Streamlit: for building the web app

**Procedure:** 
- Import the necessary libraries and the diabetic and heart disease datasets.
- Split the data into features and target variables.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data.
- Save the model using the pickle module.
- Use Streamlit to create a web application that allows users to input their own data and make predictions using the saved model.
- Include a button in the application to process the user input and make predictions.
